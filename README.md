# anpr-with-openCV-and-Tesseract
The code is based on Adrian Rosebrock's (@jrosebr1) PyImageSearch post OpenCV: Automatic License/Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) with Python, edited to be able to detect Malaysian license plates which typically has white texts on black background plate. I recommend reading through his blogpost to get a general idea of how the image processing pipeline works.

# Prerequisites
The project code utilizes the following library:

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- imutils   
- scikit-image  
- pytesseract   
- Tesseract-OCR
